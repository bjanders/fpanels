Things to fix and improve

* End display refresher and switch reader goroutines on panel `Close()`
** Use `WaitGroup`
* Use `sync.Cond` to wake display refresher only when necessary
* Code documentation
* Make it work on Windows, see https://github.com/bjanders/fpanels/issues/1
* Make it work on Mac (currently returns code -3, "bad access")
