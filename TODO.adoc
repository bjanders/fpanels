Things to fix and improve

* Use `sync.Cond` to wake display refresher only when necessary
* Code documentation
* Fix according to Go code convention
** don't use ALL_CAPS in Go names; use CamelCase
* Make it work on Windows, see https://github.com/bjanders/fpanels/issues/1
* Make it work on Mac (currently returns code -3, "bad access")
